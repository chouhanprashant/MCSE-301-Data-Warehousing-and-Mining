# Genetic Algorithm – Flow Based Explanation (Theory-Oriented)

## What is Genetic Algorithm?
Genetic Algorithm (GA) ek **soft computing optimization technique** hai
jo **natural evolution (Darwin’s theory of survival of the fittest)** se inspired hoti hai.

Simple words:
> Genetic Algorithm best solution dhundhne ke liye natural selection ka idea use karta hai.

## Why Genetic Algorithm is Used in Data Mining?
Data mining problems me:
- Search space bahut large hota hai
- Exact solution milna mushkil hota hai
- Traditional methods slow ho jaate hain

Genetic Algorithm:
- Near-optimal solution deta hai
- Complex optimization problems solve karta hai
- Global search perform karta hai

## Core Idea of Genetic Algorithm
> Genetic Algorithm solutions ki **population** par kaam karta hai
> aur har generation me unhe improve karta hai
> using selection, crossover aur mutation.

## Basic Terminology in Genetic Algorithm

### 1️⃣ Chromosome
- Ek possible solution
- Genes ka collection hota hai

---

### 2️⃣ Gene
- Chromosome ka ek part
- Solution ka ek parameter represent karta hai

---

### 3️⃣ Population
- Chromosomes ka group
- Ek generation ko represent karta hai

---

### 4️⃣ Fitness Function
- Solution ki quality measure karta hai
- Batata hai solution kitna achha hai

---

## Genetic Operators

### 1️⃣ Selection
- Best fitness wale chromosomes choose kiye jaate hain
- “Survival of the fittest” apply hota hai

---

### 2️⃣ Crossover
- Do parent chromosomes se naya offspring banta hai
- Information exchange hoti hai

---

### 3️⃣ Mutation
- Chromosome me small random change
- Diversity maintain karta hai
- Local optimum se bachata hai

---

## How Genetic Algorithm Works (Flow)
1. Initial population generate hoti hai  
2. Fitness function evaluate hoti hai  
3. Selection of best chromosomes hota hai  
4. Crossover apply hota hai  
5. Mutation apply hoti hai  
6. New generation banti hai  
7. Process repeat hota hai jab tak best solution na mile

## Role of Genetic Algorithm in Data Mining
Genetic Algorithm ka use hota hai:
- Feature selection
- Rule discovery
- Parameter optimization
- Clustering optimization

---

## Advantages of Genetic Algorithm
- Global optimum search
- Complex problems handle karta hai
- Flexible and robust
- No mathematical gradient required

---

## Limitations of Genetic Algorithm
- Computational cost high ho sakta hai
- Parameter tuning difficult hoti hai
- Exact solution guarantee nahi hoti
