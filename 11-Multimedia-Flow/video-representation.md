**# Video Representation – Very Simple Explanation (Exam-Pass Level)

## What is Video Representation?
Video Representation ka matlab hai:
**video ko data (features) ke form me represent karna**
taaki computer usse analyse kar sake.

Simple words:
> Video images (frames) ka sequence hota hai jise data me convert kiya jaata hai.

---

## Why Video Representation is Needed?
Video:
- Directly data mining ke liye suitable nahi hota
- Bahut zyada data hota hai (frames + motion)

Isliye:
> Video ko features me convert karna zaroori hota hai.

## What is a Video?
Video =  
**Sequence of images (frames) + motion over time**

Example:
- Movie
- CCTV footage
- Online lecture video

---

## How Video is Represented?
Video ko mainly **frames aur motion features** ke through represent kiya jaata hai.

## Types of Video Representation

### 1️⃣ Frame-Based Representation
- Video ko individual images (frames) me divide kiya jaata hai
- Har frame ko image ki tarah analyse kiya jaata hai

Example:
- Key frames extraction

---

### 2️⃣ Motion-Based Representation
- Frames ke beech movement analyse hota hai
- Object ka motion track kiya jaata hai

Example:
- Moving car in a video

---

### 3️⃣ Object-Based Representation
- Video me objects identify kiye jaate hain
- Unke position aur movement analyse hote hain

Example:
- Person detection in CCTV

## Advantages
- Video content ka meaningful analysis
- Automatic activity detection
- Large video data handle hota hai

---

## Limitations
- Processing slow ho sakta hai
- Storage requirement zyada hoti hai
