# Image Representation – Very Simple Explanation (Exam-Pass Level)

## What is Image Representation?
Image Representation ka matlab hai:
**image ko data (numbers/features) ke form me represent karna**
taaki computer usse analyse kar sake.

Simple words:
> Computer image ko picture nahi, numbers ke form me samajhta hai.

---

## Why Image Representation is Needed?
Images:
- Directly mine nahi ki ja sakti
- Unko pehle data form me convert karna padta hai

Isliye:
> Image Representation data mining ke liye important hai.

---

## How Images are Represented?
Image ko mainly **features** ke through represent kiya jaata hai.

---

## Types of Image Representation

### 1️⃣ Pixel-Based Representation
- Image pixels ke form me store hoti hai
- Har pixel ki intensity value hoti hai

Example:
- Black & white image
- Gray-scale image

---

### 2️⃣ Color-Based Representation
- Image ke colors analyse kiye jaate hain
- RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values use hoti hain

Example:
- Color image analysis

---

### 3️⃣ Texture-Based Representation
- Image ke surface pattern ko represent karta hai
- Smooth, rough, repeated pattern

Example:
- Cloth texture
- Wall texture

---

### 4️⃣ Shape-Based Representation
- Objects ke shape aur boundary analyse ki jaati hai

Example:
- Circle, square, human face

## Advantages
- Images ka meaningful analysis hota hai
- Automatic pattern detection
- Large image data handle hota hai

---

## Limitations
- Feature extraction complex ho sakta hai
- Processing time zyada lag sakta hai
