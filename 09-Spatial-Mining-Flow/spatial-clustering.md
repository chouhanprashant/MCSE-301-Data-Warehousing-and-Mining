# Spatial Clustering – Very Simple Explanation (Exam-Pass Level)

## Definition
Spatial Clustering ek data mining technique hai jo
**location (space) ke base par similar objects ko group** karti hai.

Simple words:
> Jo cheezein paas-paass hoti hain, unko ek cluster me rakhna = Spatial Clustering.

## What is Spatial Data?
Spatial data wo data hota hai jisme:
- Location information hoti hai
- Coordinates (x, y), latitude–longitude use hota hai

Example:
- Cities ka location
- Map data
- Satellite images

---

## Why Spatial Clustering?
Spatial Clustering ka use hota hai:
- Nearby locations ko group karne ke liye
- Area-based patterns samajhne ke liye

Example:
- Crime-prone areas identify karna
- Similar weather regions find karna

## Core Idea
> Spatial Clustering distance aur density ke base par
> nearby spatial objects ko ek cluster me group karti hai.

## How Spatial Clustering Works (Simple Flow)

1. Spatial data input liya jaata hai  
2. Distance ya density measure choose hota hai  
3. Nearby points group kiye jaate hain  
4. Clusters form hote hain

## Applications of Spatial Clustering
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Urban planning
- Weather analysis
- Image segmentation
- Crime analysis

---

## Advantages
- Location-based patterns samajh aate hain
- Large spatial data analyse hota hai
- Decision making improve hoti hai

---

## Limitations
- Distance calculation complex ho sakti hai
- Noise aur outliers problem create kar sakte hain

---

## Exam Trigger Line
Spatial Clustering groups nearby spatial objects into clusters based on location and distance.
