# Spatial Mining – Basics (Very Simple, Exam-Pass Level)

## Definition
Spatial Mining ek data mining technique hai jo
**location-based (spatial) data** se useful patterns nikalti hai.

Simple words:
> Spatial Mining map ya location wale data ko analyse karti hai.

---

## What is Spatial Data?
Spatial data wo data hota hai jisme **location information** hoti hai.

Example:
- City locations (latitude, longitude)
- Maps
- Satellite images
- GIS data

---

## Why Spatial Mining?
Spatial data bahut bada aur complex hota hai.
Spatial Mining help karti hai:
- Location-based patterns samajhne me
- Area-wise analysis karne me

Example:
- Crime hotspots find karna
- Flood-prone areas identify karna

---

## Core Idea of Spatial Mining
> Spatial Mining nearby locations aur spatial relationships
> ke base par patterns discover karti hai.

---

## Main Tasks in Spatial Mining

### 1️⃣ Spatial Clustering
- Nearby locations ko ek group me rakhna

Example:
Nearby cities ka cluster banana

---

### 2️⃣ Spatial Classification
- Location ke base par class assign karna

Example:
High-risk vs Low-risk areas

---

### 3️⃣ Spatial Association
- Spatial objects ke beech relationship nikalna

Example:
River ke paas flood chances zyada

---

### 4️⃣ Spatial Trends
- Area-wise change observe karna

Example:
Population density ka increase

## Applications of Spatial Mining
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Urban planning
- Environmental monitoring
- Weather forecasting
- Location-based services

---

## Advantages
- Location-based decision making
- Hidden spatial patterns milte hain
- Large spatial data analyse hota hai

---

## Limitations
- Data complex hota hai
- High computation cost
- Noise aur errors ho sakte hain

## One-Line Understanding
Spatial Mining discovers useful patterns from location-based spatial data.

## Exam Trigger Line
Spatial Mining is the process of extracting interesting patterns from spatial databases.
