# Neural Network – Theory Focused (Exam-Oriented)

## What is a Neural Network?
Neural Network ek **computational model** hai jo
**human brain ke working principle** se inspired hota hai.

Isme:
- Artificial neurons hote hain
- Neurons ek-dusre se connected hote hain
- Data ko process karke output generate hota hai

Simple words:
> Neural Network data se seekhta hai aur patterns identify karta hai.

## Why Neural Networks are Used in Data Mining?
Neural Networks:
- Complex patterns easily detect karte hain
- Non-linear data ko handle kar sakte hain
- Noisy aur incomplete data ke saath bhi kaam karte hain

Isliye ye data mining me bahut useful hote hain.

## Structure of a Neural Network

Neural Network mainly 3 layers se bana hota hai:

1. **Input Layer**
   - Raw data accept karti hai
   - Har neuron ek input feature represent karta hai

2. **Hidden Layer(s)**
   - Actual processing hoti hai
   - Weights aur activation function use hote hain

3. **Output Layer**
   - Final result / prediction deta hai
   - Class label ya numerical output hota hai

## Working of Neural Network (Flow)
1. Input data input layer me jata hai  
2. Data weights ke saath hidden layer me process hota hai  
3. Activation function apply hota hai  
4. Output layer final result produce karti hai  
5. Network error se seekhta hai aur improve karta hai

## Supervised Training Method
- Training data **labeled hota hai**
- Input ke saath correct output diya hota hai
- Error calculate karke weights update kiye jaate hain

Example:
- Spam vs Non-Spam email classification

## Unsupervised Training Method
- Training data **unlabeled hota hai**
- Network khud se patterns discover karta hai

Example:
- Customer clustering
- Pattern discovery

## Role of Neural Network in Data Mining
Neural Networks ka use hota hai:
- Classification
- Prediction
- Pattern recognition
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis

## Advantages of Neural Network
- High accuracy
- Self-learning capability
- Handles noisy data
- Complex relationships model kar sakta hai

---

## Disadvantages of Neural Network
- Training time zyada hota hai
- Black box model (logic explain karna mushkil)
- Large dataset chahiye hota hai
