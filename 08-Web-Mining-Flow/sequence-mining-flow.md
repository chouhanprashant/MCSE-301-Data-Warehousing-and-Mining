# Sequence Mining – Very Simple Explanation (Exam-Pass Level)

## Definition
Sequence Mining ek data mining technique hai jo
**data me events ke order (sequence)** ko discover karti hai.

Simple words:
> Sequence Mining batata hai kaun si cheez **pehle aur baad me** hoti hai.

---

## Why Sequence Mining?
Real life me:
- Actions ek order me hote hain
- Sirf items nahi, unka order bhi important hota hai

Example:
Customer pehle Login karta hai  
Phir Product dekhta hai  
Phir Purchase karta hai  

---

## Core Idea
> Sequence Mining frequent **ordered patterns** nikalta hai.

Matlab:
A → B → C  
(Ye order baar-baar repeat hota hai)

---

## What is a Sequence?
Sequence = ordered list of events

Example:
⟨Login, Search, Purchase⟩

## How Sequence Mining Works (Simple Flow)

1. Sequence data collect hota hai  
2. Frequent events identify hote hain  
3. Events ke order check kiye jaate hain  
4. Repeated sequences find ki jaati hain

## Use of Sequence Mining
- Web click analysis
- Customer behavior analysis
- Purchase pattern analysis
- Medical treatment analysis

---

## Advantages
- User behavior samajhne me madad
- Prediction improve hoti hai
- Useful patterns milte hain

---

## Limitations
- Large data me slow ho sakta hai
- Order analysis complex ho sakta hai

---

## Exam Trigger Line
Sequence Mining discovers frequent ordered patterns from sequence data.
